**This is still a work in progress, and has no releases available**

CloudSonic is a music collection server and streamer, optmized to run on cheap VPS servers. It implements the
[Subsonic](http://www.subsonic.org) API

The project's main goals are:

- Be fully compatible with available [Subsonic clients](http://www.subsonic.org/pages/apps.jsp)
  (actively being tested with
  [DSub](http://www.subsonic.org/pages/apps.jsp#dsub),
  [Music Stash](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ghenry22.mymusicstash),
  [Jamstash](http://www.subsonic.org/pages/apps.jsp#jamstash) and
  [SubFire](http://www.subsonic.org/pages/apps.jsp#subfire))
- Import and use all metadata from iTunes, so that you can optionally keep using iTunes to manage your music
- Implement Smart Playlists, as iTunes

### Supported Subsonic API version

I'm currently trying to implement all functionality from API v1.8.0, with some exceptions.

Check the (almost) up to date [compatibility chart](https://github.com/cloudsonic/sonic-server/wiki/Compatibility) for what is working.

### Installation

As this is a work in progress, there are no installers yet. To have the server running in your computer, follow the steps in the
Development Environment section below, then run it with:

```
$ export SONIC_MUSICFOLDER="/path/to/your/iTunes Library.xml"
$ make run
```

The server should start listening for requests. The default configuration is:

- Port: `4533`
- User: `anyone`
- Password: `wordpass`

To override this or any other configuration, create a file named `sonic.toml` in the project folder. For all options see the [configuration.go](conf/configuration.go) file

### Development Environment

You will need to install [Go 1.13](https://golang.org/dl/)

Then install dependencies:

```
$ make setup
```

Some useful commands:

```bash
# Start local server (with hot reload)
$ make run

# Run all tests
$ make test
```
